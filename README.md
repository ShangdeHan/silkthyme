#### Hello It's Me ðŸŒ¿

I'm a 3rd year undergrad at UC Davis majoring in CS and minoring in math. 

I do web development on [Pinnacle](http://pinnacle.us.org/). I'm the editor for WiCS at Davis. I work on the controls subsystem for [UCD's Hyperloop team](https://www.davishyperloop.com/) (in 2018, the team went to compete at the SpaceX HQ. What I wouldn't give to see Of Course I Still Love You in person).

I was an SDE intern at Amazon in the summers of my freshman and sophomore years, where I worked with cool people who were skilled at both coding and [social deduction](https://proavalonbetatesting.herokuapp.com/). I built a new microservice to help fight seller fraud!

I'm currently learning Express.js, React, Electron, and Sass. I am interested in computer vision and AI, and [all](https://shihmengli.github.io/3D-Photo-Inpainting/) [the](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3) [ways](https://sketch2code.azurewebsites.net/) we can program computers to do [our](https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential) jobs.

Trivia: I like movies and indie music. Also any dessert with matcha in it. My favorite activity is curling up with a book and not moving for 5+ hours.
