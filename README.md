### Hello It's Me ðŸŒ¿ Christina 

I'm a 3rd year at UC Davis majoring in CS and minoring in math.

I was an SDE intern at Amazon in the summers of my freshman and sophomore years. Not only did I have a blast playing Resistance with my coworkers during our weekly game lunches, I also built a new microservice running on AWS infrastructure to help fight seller fraud! In addition, I'm a web developer for [Pinnacle](http://pinnacle.us.org/), the Olympics of Hackathons. I'm the editor for WiCS at Davis. I'm an engineer on the controls subsystem for [Oneloop](https://www.davishyperloop.com/), UCD's Hyperloop team (in 2018, the team went to compete at the SpaceX HQ. What I wouldn't give to see Falcon 9 and Of Course I Still Love You in person).

I want to get into more front-end, especially these frameworks: Express.js, React, Electron, and SCSS. I am also interested in computer vision and AI, and [all](https://shihmengli.github.io/3D-Photo-Inpainting/) [the](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3) [ways](https://sketch2code.azurewebsites.net/) we can program computers to do [our](https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential) jobs.

Outside of CS, I like Murakami novels, Wes Anderson movies, and city pop. I also enjoy swimming and climbing trees.
